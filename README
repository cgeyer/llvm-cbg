Version 1.00

How to get the backend working:
	(1) Download LLVM 2.9 from http://llvm.org/
	(2) Extract the archive 'tar xvf llvm-2.9.tgz'
	(4) Copy the patch file (add-cbg-backend.patch) to your llvm root directory 
	    (usually something like /home/user/llvm-2.9/)
	(5) Change to llvm root directory and apply patch file 
	    'patch -p1 < add-cbg-backend.patch'
	(6) Run configure: './configure --enable-targets=cbg --enable-optimized'
	(7) Run make with multiple jobs to speed-up the comipling process:
	    'make -j <NUM>'
	(8) Change to <llvm-root>/Release/bin directory and test for cbg target:
	    './llvm-as < /dev/null | ./llc --march=cbg --mcpu=help'
	(9) To be able to run all benchmarks, make sure you install or download llvm-gcc

More information to be added soon...
